# SwMovieChecklist

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Requirements

Here are the requirements given for this code challenge. Let me know if you think I met them. One thought I had was to add an 'ADD' functionality to add to the list, but I think this fulfills the base requirements.

"For this programming challenge please create a web page that contains the following:
A movie checklist that is vertically and horizontally centered on a page with the following list of items:
1. Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope

...etc...

7. Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens

If any of above checklist items is checked then the text must be grayed out and crossed out.

Add the following item to the checklist which will not be checkable:
Star Wars Episode IX

To build this web page the minimum requirements are:
- avoid using any inline styles
- Use any current JavaScript framework technology"

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
